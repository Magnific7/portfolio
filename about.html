        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <h3>“Learning to code is learning to create and innovate.”<br>
          —Enda Kenny, Taoiseach, Ireland.</h3>
        <p>As a child even growing up I never considered myself as one to be into coding ,, fact.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact in high school i took Physics,Chemistry,and Maths.in my gap year I worked in hotel and
          obviously all these are so far from coding.</p>
        <p>After my high school is when i gave it a try in Moringa Wecode program honestly speaking I gave it no
          guarantee <br>
          but look at me now i can't picture myself any in career that doesn't involve coding.</p>
        <p>Apart from coding i would say I am just a girl like anyother that loves movies and books and
          games&#127918(This is because of coding I guess ).</p>
        <p>I would also say that coding in such a short time has entirely changed my ways of thinking and aspirations
          in
          life and it is not a bad thing I look forward to more I can do with this &#128187.</p>
        <p>It is not always easy but atleast it is exciting and that is enough.</p>
